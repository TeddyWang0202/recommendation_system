Recommendation system building with online article data(Chinese) and tutorial

I only upload how I implement recommendation building under Keras framework.

The main purpose here is to convey the concept and tutorial.

If one wants to access my web-log, online article content data, please contact me :). (a26006587@gmail.com)

This project includes several factorization models in recommendation system and natural language processing.

For further information, I'd maintained my medium and recorded detailedly about this project. 

There will be 4 parts of this project.
* [Data intro and EDA](https://medium.com/@a26006587/implicit-feedback-recommendation-system-i-intro-and-datasets-eda-eda16764602a) 
* [Model-based collaborative modeling. Matrix factorization, NMF, SVD++, Neural CF, Implicit feedback](https://medium.com/@a26006587/implicit-feedback-recommendation-system-ii-collaborative-filtering-27be600197f1)
* [Content-based modeling. Embedding features extraction with fine-tuned BERT](https://medium.com/@a26006587/implicit-feedback-recommendation-system-iii-content-based-recommendation-f607264c0355)
